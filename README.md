## To deploy Clippy! to your entire tenant or just yourself:
1. Download the [manifest file](https://github.com/cypheredout/microsoft-teams-clippy-app/blob/master/manifest/Clippy.zip)
1. If deploying for just yourself click the 'Upload a custom app' button that is found in the app store. If the button is not available for you then you must contact your Office 365 tenant administrator to either enable sideloading or to install the manifest to the entire tenant (using the same button in their Microsoft Teams client):
